# BigData
This repo contains the tools and code we used to complete our project. 
Some of the code was run in these notebooks but some of this code was run on our local system - outlined in the document submitted,,
The code that was used is:
1. PreProcessingData.ipynb - this was used to preprocess our data and put it into a file
2. SQLBash.ipynb - put the file into a db and run queries
3. sum_distance.sh - bash command
4. mapper.py & reducer.py - files used for hadoop

Hadoop was run locally so all the commands used may not be listed but we put down as much as we could.
